# ShopVerse - Premium eCommerce Template

## Overview

ShopVerse is a modern, fully responsive eCommerce website template built with vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, using Bootstrap 5 for responsive layouts. It's designed as a multipurpose online store template suitable for fashion, electronics, furniture, and beauty products. The template features 8 complete pages including home, shop, product details, cart, checkout, login/register, contact, and about pages. Built for simplicity and performance, it uses no JavaScript frameworks and relies on client-side rendering with localStorage for state persistence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Single Page Application (SPA) Pattern with Multi-Page Support**
- Pure vanilla JavaScript without frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- Client-side rendering with dynamic content loading
- Event-driven architecture for user interactions
- State management through localStorage for cart and theme persistence

**UI Framework & Styling**
- Bootstrap 5 grid system for responsive layouts
- Custom CSS with CSS Variables for theming support
- Dark/Light mode toggle with system-wide theme persistence
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Font Awesome icons for UI elements
- Google Fonts (Inter family) for typography

**Component Structure**
- Shared navigation bar across all pages
- Reusable product cards with hover effects
- Modal-based interactions (planned for product quick view)
- Form validation components for checkout and contact pages
- Shopping cart widget with real-time badge updates

### Data Layer

**Product Data Management**
- JSON-based product catalog stored in `assets/data/products.json`
- Product schema includes: id, name, category, price, rating, images, description, features, stock status
- Client-side filtering and sorting capabilities
- Category-based product organization (electronics, fashion, furniture, beauty)

**State Management**
- LocalStorage for persistent cart data across sessions
- LocalStorage for theme preference (dark/light mode)
- No server-side state or database integration
- Cart operations: add, remove, update quantity, calculate totals

**Data Flow**
- Products loaded from JSON file on page initialization
- Cart state synchronized between localStorage and UI
- Real-time cart badge updates across all pages
- Dynamic product rendering based on filters/sorts

### Page Architecture

**Multi-Page Structure**
- `index.html` - Home page with hero, featured products, categories
- `pages/shop.html` - Product catalog with filtering and sorting
- `pages/product-detail.html` - Individual product details with image gallery
- `pages/cart.html` - Shopping cart with quantity management
- `pages/checkout.html` - Checkout form with billing/shipping
- `pages/auth.html` - Login and registration forms
- `pages/contact.html` - Contact form with information
- `pages/about.html` - About page with company information

**Routing & Navigation**
- Traditional multi-page navigation (no SPA routing)
- URL query parameters for product detail pages
- Consistent navigation across all pages
- Breadcrumb navigation for better UX

### JavaScript Architecture

**Core Modules**
- Theme management (`initTheme()`, `toggleTheme()`)
- Product loading and rendering (`loadProducts()`)
- Cart operations (`addToCart()`, `updateCart()`, `removeFromCart()`)
- Filter and sort functionality for shop page
- Form validation for checkout and contact pages
- Image gallery for product details

**Event Handling**
- Global event listeners for cart actions
- Form submission handlers with validation
- Theme toggle event handlers
- Product filter/sort change listeners
- Scroll events for sticky navbar

### Performance Optimizations

**Asset Loading**
- External CDN resources for Bootstrap and Font Awesome
- Optimized images from Unsplash with specified dimensions
- Lazy loading considerations for product images
- Minimal JavaScript bundle (vanilla JS, no frameworks)

**SEO Optimization**
- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- Meta tags for description, keywords, and social sharing
- Alt tags for images
- Structured data markup potential for products
